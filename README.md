# Elections_Again
They say its  about popularity but I say its a game of Numbers. After 5 years any leadert seeking electrol position goes back to the ground (As they call it), all this with an aim of convincing the voters to vote for them through their manifestos. The youth or do I call them Gen Z very vocal in all social media platforms but do they actuially vote.
